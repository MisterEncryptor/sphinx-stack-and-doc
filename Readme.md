# Stack and Apidoc with Sphinx

This is a simple implementation of a stack data structure. And I'm attempting to generate documentation for this in Sphinx.

`src/stack.py` is the module I'm attempting to document.
The first level of `docs/` contains Sphinx's `conf.py`, `Makefile` and other `.rst` files generated by the `sphinx-apidoc` command.
